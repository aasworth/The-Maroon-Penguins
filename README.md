# The-Maroon-Penguins
Final Project for C200

Welcome to our game! This game is set inside of a futuristic amusement park called "Wonder World." The main character finds himself inside after hours and all he knows is the world is different outside but he doesn't know what to expect. The players goals is to traverse through the amusement park and find a way to view what the world looks like outside. 

During play, Pictures of the world will pop up on your screen. Once the pictures pop up, you will have to close the picture and then make your option of where to go or what to do, and then another picture will pop up. You will just need to close it again and repeat, and that is how the game is played.

Have fun! I hope you find what you are looking for.
